        <p>If you have any questions on how to use DOT, or its editor, feel free to contact the studio at <a href="mailto:projectferomine@gmail.com">projectferomine@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>If you wish to join WireZapp, feel free to contact me as well :D</p>

<p>The EXE is located under Editor+Engine/Debug/DOT_Editor</p>

<p>In order to compile DOT, you need the newest version of Qt (As of November 2014) [5.3.2] for Windows.
Both 32 and 64 bit versions are required. A minimum of Visual Studio 2013 is also required for compilation.</p>

<p>Also required:
    -OpenGL
    -JRE (Oddly... Never could figure out why)
-UPDATE YOUR VIDEO DRIVERS!!!! It has a nasty habbit of crashing on older NVIDIA drivers.</p>

<p>-If you are experiencing difficulty on an AMD CPU, particularly the bulldog series, please contact me. We can't solve this bug yet :(</p>

<p>Later versions of DOT will require Visual Studio 2013 Profesional or better, as well as a full
directX 11 installation.</p>

<p>We will not be releasing source code on Linux and Mac OSX versions of DOT. If you want access to these
versions, please contact us at the email provided above.</p>

<p>If you wish to use DOT in a commercial (INDIE!!!) product, please contact me before integrating DOT into your product
(We want to make sure that its integrated well into most if not all solutions).</p>

<p>If you wish to use DOT in a commercial non-indie product, please contact me and we will schedule a meeting.</p>

<p>If you wish to utilize the newest version of DOT (The open source version will always be a minimum of 10 versions behind
our inhouse edition), please contact me to discuss licensing.</p>
